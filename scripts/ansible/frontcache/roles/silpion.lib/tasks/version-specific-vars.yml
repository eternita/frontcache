# TODO [kraM] Fix assumption on roles path in play -- Mon 06 Jun 2016 03:00:13 PM CEST
#             There are chances that Ansible will support role-aware includes
#             with the next releases, e.g. - include: role=silpion.lib file=vars/versions/noop.yml

# Roles commonly include variables for middleware version specific configuration.

    - "{{ role_path }}/vars/versions/{{ version }}.yml"
    - "{{ playbook_dir }}/roles/silpion.lib/vars/versions/noop.yml"
